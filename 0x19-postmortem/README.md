#Issue Summary:

* Duration: The outage occurred on October 15, 2023, from 10:00 AM to 1:30 PM (UTC).

* Impact: The outage affected our e-commerce website, resulting in slow response times and, in some cases, complete unavailability. Approximately 30% of our users experienced degraded performance.

* Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was a sudden surge in traffic due to an unexpected promotion campaign. Our servers were unable to handle the increased load.

## Timeline:

* 10:00 AM: The issue was detected when our monitoring system triggered alerts for high server load.

* 10:15 AM: The incident was noticed by the on-call engineer, who immediately started investigating.

* 10:30 AM: Actions taken: The engineer initiated a review of server logs and database queries to identify potential bottlenecks.

* 11:00 AM: Misleading investigation: Initially, the engineer suspected a database issue and started optimizing queries.

* 12:00 PM: With no significant improvements, the incident was escalated to the DevOps team for a broader investigation.

* 1:30 PM: The incident was resolved by adding more servers to the load balancer, which mitigated the traffic spike.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

* Root Cause: The root cause was the sudden increase in traffic due to a successful promotional campaign. Our system was not auto-scaling to handle the load.

* Resolution: We addressed the issue by implementing auto-scaling for our servers. We also optimized our database queries and added caching to reduce server load.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

1. To prevent a similar issue in the future, we will implement automated scaling of server resources based on traffic load.

2. We will improve monitoring to detect traffic spikes earlier.

3. We'll conduct load testing to ensure our system can handle expected traffic increases.

4. Regularly review and optimize database queries to improve system performance.

5. Implement content delivery network (CDN) services to serve static assets more efficiently.
